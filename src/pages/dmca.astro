						Automated Profits Incorporated ("we," "our," or "us") respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), we will respond promptly to notices of alleged infringement that are reported to our designated copyright agent, identified below.
						
						**Reporting Copyright Infringements**
						
						If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content hosted on our platform infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a written notification pursuant to the DMCA by sending it to our designated copyright agent via email at [support@automatedProfits.Co](mailto:support@automatedProfits.Co) or by postal mail at 308 Poplar Street, Kamloops, B.C., Canada, V2B 4B8.
						
						The notification must include the following information:
						
						1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
						
						2. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, along with information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.
						
						3. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address.
						
						4. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
						
						5. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
						
						**Response to Valid DMCA Notifications**
						
						Upon receipt of a valid DMCA notification, we will take appropriate actions under the DMCA, which may include the removal or disabling of access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. We will also notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing material, who will have the opportunity to file a counter-notice.
						
						**Counter-Notices**
						
						If you believe that your material has been removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may send a counter-notice to our designated copyright agent at the contact information provided above. The counter-notice must include the following information:
						
						1. Your physical or electronic signature.
						
						2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
						
						3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
						
						4. Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
